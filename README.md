## Module comparison

| Module     | Description                                    | Native | RuSSH |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Filesystem | Access to the Linux filesystem                 | âœ…      | âœ…     |
| Network    | Access to forwarding TCP and Unix sockets      | âœ…      | ðŸš§    |
| Executor   | A simple model for executing Linux programs    | ðŸš§     | ðŸš§    |
| HTTP       | Async HTTP client on Linux and not the host OS | ðŸš§     | ðŸš§    |

Implementation details:
- Filesystem: Tokio "async" I/O on native and SFTP on SSH
- Network: no-op on native and forwarding on SSH (`tcpip`, `streamlocal` extensions)
- Executor: Tokio async process on native and simple execution / requested PTY with less features on SSH
- HTTP: reqwest on native and remote-side raw curl on SSH
